# A-Bayesian-Variable-Selection-Method-for-Skewed-and-Heteroscedastic-Response
We propose new Bayesian methods with proper theoretical justification for selecting and estimating a sparse regression coefficient vector for skewed heteroscedastic response. Our novel Bayesian procedures effectively estimate the median and other quantile functions, accommodate non-local prior for regression effects without compromising ease of implementation via sampling based tools. We also extend our method to deal with some observations with very large errors. The link for the paper is https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.09100. This repository contains R code to select important variables using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The code is available for public use.
